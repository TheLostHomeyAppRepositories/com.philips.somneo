The light gradually becomes stronger before your wake-up time, allowing you to wake up naturally. In addition, the external AmbiTrack sensor measures the most important factors in your bedroom and provides feedback in the Homey app. In addition to waking up, the Somneo Connected also helps you fall asleep by guiding your breathing with lights through RelaxBreath."
